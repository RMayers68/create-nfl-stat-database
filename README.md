This repository is for a program to pull all NFL game stats from 1970-2023 to place in a database so that I could use them for an app I'm working on as a hobby. 
Right now it currently only scrapes game scores and somehow against all logic, the 2022 Buffalo Bills are invulnerable to scraping methods so far. Will update as I do more.
